    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div class="description">
        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Sanket Suman Patra</strong>, a student of Computer Science Engineering (CSE) at <strong>ITER, SOA University</strong>. This project is a part of my personal journey to explore the world of web development. Iâ€™m passionate about coding and constantly looking to enhance my skills in various technologies.</p>

        <p>For this project, I chose *Django*, a high-level Python web framework, due to its simplicity and power. Django allowed me to build this application quickly and efficiently, with its built-in tools and structure helping me focus on the unique parts of my project instead of reinventing the wheel. Being Python-based, it made the development process smoother and faster, which was very helpful during my project timeline.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Why I Love Django</h3>
        <p>I really enjoyed working with Django because it is easy to learn and use, and its Python-based syntax made it much more intuitive. With Django, I could create a fully functional web application with minimal effort, thanks to its excellent documentation and strong community support. The speed at which I could develop and deploy features made it the perfect choice for my solo project.</p>
